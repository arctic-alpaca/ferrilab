# Afterword

Thanks for reading! We hope this guide was useful to you.

**Please** feel both welcomed and encouraged to ask us any clarifying questions
(contact information for myrrlyn is in the `CONTRIBUTING` document), or to
[file an issue][0] if any of it is confusing or even send a PR if you have
improvements!

Ferrilab has been a work of intensely deep focus and research for over four
years. It is a complex and difficult topic, and we are absolutely certain that
we have information and context that we haven’t sufficiently serialized for
everyone else to see.

Thank you for using our crates. We are delighted that other people have found
our work both interesting and useful, and we’re glad that we’ve been able to
help people like you write better programs.
