/*! View constructors for memory regions.

The `&BitSlice` type is a referential view over existing memory. The inherent
constructors are awkward to call, as they require function syntax rather than
method syntax, and must provide a token for the memory type even though this is
provided by the prior binding.

This module provides a view trait, `ViewBits`, which provides `BitSlice`
constructors available in method-call syntax with only ordering type parameters.

In addition, the traits `AsBits` and `AsBitsMut` are analogues of [`AsRef`] and
[`AsMut`], respectively. These traits have a blanket implementation for all
`A: As{Ref,Mut}<[T: BitStore]>`, so that any type that implements a view to a
suitable memory region automatically implements a view to that regionâ€™s bits.

These traits are distinct because `ViewBits` combines the im/mutable view
functions into one trait, and can provide specialized implementations with a
slight performance increase over the generic, but `AsBits{,Mut}` can fit in the
generic type system of any library without undue effort.

/** Views a type that can store bits as a bit-slice.

This trait is implemented on all `T: BitStore` types, and the arrays and slices
of them that are supported by the standard library.

This means that until type-level integers are stabilized, only arrays in
`[T: BitStore; 0 ..= 32]` will implement the trait; wider arrays will need to
reborrow as slices `[T]` in order to use the slice implementation.

If you have a type that contains a bit-storage type that can be viewed with this
trait, then you can implement this trait by forwarding to the interior view.

/** Views a region as an immutable bit-slice only.

This trait is an analogue to the [`AsRef`] trait, in that it enables any type to
provide an immutable-only view of a bit slice.

It does not require an `AsRef<[T: BitStore]>` implementation, and a blanket
implementation for all such types is provided. This allows you to choose whether
to implement only one of `AsBits<T>` or `AsRef<[T]>`, and gain a bit-slice view
with either choice.

# Type Parameters

- `T`: The underlying storage region.

# Notes

You are not *forbidden* from creating multiple views with different element
types to the same region, but doing so is likely to cause inconsistent and
unsurprising behavior.

Refrain from implementing this trait with more than one storage argument unless
you are sure that you can uphold the memory region requirements of all of them,
and are aware of the behavior conflicts that may arise.
