/*! Memory management.

The `BitStore` trait defines the types that can be used in `bitvec` data
structures, and describes how those data structures are allowed to access the
memory they govern.

	access::BitAccess,
	mem::BitMemory,

use core::{
	cell::Cell,
	sync::atomic,

/** Generalize over types which may be used to access memory holding bits.

This trait is implemented on the fundamental integers, their `Cell<>` wrappers,
and (if present) their `Atomic` variants. Users provide this type as a parameter
to their data structures in order to inform the structure of how it may access
memory.

Specifically, this has the advantage that a `BitSlice<_, Cell<_>>` knows that it
has a view of memory that will not undergo concurrent modification. As such, it
can skip using atomic accesses, and just use ordinary load/store instructions,
without fear of causing observable race conditions.

The associated types `Mem` and `Alias` allow implementors to know the register
width of the memory they describe (`Mem`) and to change the aliasing status of
a slice.

A universal property of `BitSlice` regions is that for any handle, it may be
described as a triad of:

- zero or one partially-used, aliased, elements at the head
- zero or more wholly-used, unaliased, elements in the body
- zero or one partially-used, aliased, elements at the tail

As such, a `&BitSlice` reference with any aliasing type can be split into its
`Self::Alias` variant for the edges, and `Cell<Self::Mem>` for the interior,
without violating memory safety.
